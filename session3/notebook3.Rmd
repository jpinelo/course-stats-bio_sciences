## LINEAR REGRESSION

* **Independent** variable = **Predictor** (traditionally denoted x and plotted on this axis)   
* **Dependent** variable = **Response** (y)   

Linear model:    

> *y = ax +b*   

Where:   
* a = slope   
* b = intercept   

Fitting the model to the data consists in finding the best estimates for a and b.         
Finding the estimates can be done through several methods. Here we use the **Minimization of the Residual Square Sum**.      

#### Minimization of the Residual Square Sum   
Residuals are the magnitude of the vector between each real point to the model fitted (vertical straight line between each point and the model).
Residuals are represented by the dashed lines in the figure below.

#### Example of Linear Fit, or Linear Regression        
```{r}
data(iris)
str(iris)
```


#### Look at all pairwise combinations        
```{r}
pairs(iris[,-5], lower.panel=NULL, col=as.numeric(iris$Species))
````
In this example, it looks like petal length and petal with have a strong and **linear** association.

To create a model we use `lm()`, which takes the dependent and independent variables.   
`lm(data= data, dependent_var~independent_var)` OR `lm(data$dependent_var~data$independent_var)`   
The formulation can be read as:      

> *Dependent variable* **as predicted by** *Independent variable*   

####     
```{r}
model <- lm(data= iris, Petal.Width~Petal.Length)
````
The formulation above means: *Petal width predicted by petal length*
